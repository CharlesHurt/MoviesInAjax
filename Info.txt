Use the OMDb API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to allow users to find information about movies.
Use jQuery AJAX methods to make a page which is dynamic and informative.

You may also use Bootstrap to make styling easier, if you'd like.

MVP:
Allow a user to find a movie by title.
Have search inputs which will allow the user to specify at least title, year,
and type.  The title should be required to make the request, but your app
should work appropriately whether or not they enter the other information.
These inputs should also be appropriate for the data (number input for the
year, perhaps a dropdown for the type.)
The found movie should be displayed nicely to the user, including the movie poster.
Include a link to the movie's IMDb page.  (you can construct this link from
the IMDb id which comes with the movie.)
If the movie isn't found, inform the user in an unobtrusive way.  If you are
using Bootstrap, you may like to check out an alert div as inspiration.  Hide
this when they've made a better search.
